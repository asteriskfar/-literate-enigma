# Better information

Using this data structure Sigchain provides transparent real time information about Sigcoin pathways so that credit-worthiness can be predicted using analysis of historical transactions. From this basis we are able to establish entirely new models for trust.

This architecture enables the identity of a tokens issuer to be cryptographically provable wherever it transacts through the graph. As any issuers credit-worthiness can be determined by how much of their previous credit they have repaid it becomes possible to determine both the issuer of a token and their credit rating. The Sigchain transaction graph is a financial data gold mine and will enable a new market of fintech services including analysis and prediction services.
