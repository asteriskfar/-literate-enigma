Using a natively structured data set Sigchain provides transparent real time information about Sigcoin pathways so that credit-worthiness can be predicted using analysis of historical transactions. From this basis we are able to establish entirely new models for trust.

By replacing traditional blockchain architecture with a signature chain, or ‘sigchain’, we place credit issuance in the hands of market participants themselves. Sigchain is the first digital currency to work this way.

The Sigchain transaction graph is a financial data gold mine and will enable a new market of fintech services including analysis and prediction services.
