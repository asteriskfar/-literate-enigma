## Our markets

Despite fundamental problems with fiat currency, unstable markets and hundreds of trillions of dollars of debt, it’s actually an exciting time for money. The blockchain has started an important conversation about money, and now banks, regulators and technology companies are exploring cryptocurrency and new fintech.
Given much attention and investment, fintech focus has been almost entirely on wallets, exchanges, cryptocurrencies, payment rails and settlement systems. Our increasingly globalised marketplace needs a fundamental design shift to overcome many of the world-scale economic challenges we face today. The blockchain may well have started an important conversation but it is simply one step in money’s evolution.

# An economic operating system

An economy is a large-scale and sophisticated mechanistic device to utilise the specialisation of our individual and group skill to produce value. It enables many people to play an individual role in total production. It is the way all of mankind is able to collaborate together to meet our collective needs.

Every time an individual makes a transaction it turns tiny gears of a massive machine that together have a very real, very noticeable effect on the entire economic system and therefore on society, community and culture.

Our lives are directly influenced by the *systems* we use to group together to manage the earths resources and self organise. The design of these systems will determine our sustainable success and well-being. The earth and environment are direct beneficiaries of these systems.

We propose an economic system that integrates money, governance and reputation. We introduce a method for issuing and redeeming a digital credit note using a mechanism that solves large-scale economic challenges and aims to create a sustainable global economy and a free market.
