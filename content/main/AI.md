# AI is stupid

Artificial intelligence is a very broad term

Humans are famous for anthropomorphising their view and treatment of objects outside themselves. AI is wonderfully susceptible to this mistake. Make AI like a human brain, a single device that we try to make work like our own brain, and then spends years speculating about whether it’s conscious or has feelings. And make robots that look like human bodies. This is embarrassing.

What’s the purpose of an ‘AI’?, Who’s is it? and Who gets to use it? At what cost? By what mechanism will it be useful to who?

Don’t we all want an AI that is useful and safe? An AI that we can trust? By what mechanism will an AI be truly trustable? The more ‘intelligent’ these tools become, the more imperative it is that we can trust them. How will this work?

When the true nature of the money tool is understood it becomes obvious that the AI we all want, and could trust, must be an economically infused device. This is the foundation of the Autonomic Intelligence design.

## The first of it’s kind.

Autonomic intelligence is about understanding what tool will best have humanity behave intelligently, and build an intelligent production mechanism.

“IF WE TRY TO RUN THE ECONOMY FOR THE BENEFIT OF A SINGLE GROUP OR CLASS, WE SHALL INJURE OR DESTROY ALL GROUPS, INCLUDING THE MEMBERS OF THE VERY CLASS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO RUN IT. WE MUST RUN THE ECONOMY FOR EVERYBODY.” HENRY HAZLITT ‘ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON’
