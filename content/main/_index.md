Through history we've come to think of money as coinage and notes and so we've come to lose the real notion of money being a credit relationship between two trading parties.

Exchange itself is more fundamental than money as exchange only needs a ledger to record it not an object called money as such. In both fiat and cryptocurrency systems the dollar or token is assumed to have value in-and-of itself. Investment models emphasise the buying, owning and trading of tokens, in the hope they go up in price regardless of what they actually represent. That’s the current culture of the token economy. Although exciting this is nonsense and can't be sustained. This tulip mania sentiment is both economically risky and adds to the instability of global markets.

That’s not what Sigchain is about.

Instead of fiddling at the edges with variations of the blockchain template we decided to reconsider the design of money itself at a more fundamental level.
