# Sigchain

<!-- ![Screenshot Mockup](/images/screenshots/export-multidevices-2-smaller.png) -->

Each participant has their own blockchain, their own ledger, which only they can sign transactions to, equivalent to writing a personal cheque. By replacing traditional blockchain architecture with a signature chain, or ‘sigchain’, we place credit issuance in the hands of market participants themselves. Sigchain is the first digital currency to work this way.
